"Hi! I'm presenting Aurora, a smart navigation and social carpool platform built specifically for the Kotlin Multiplatform Contest 2026.

Aurora is NOT a Hello World app - it's a production-ready application with over 25 screens, 15,000 lines of code, and real-world integrations including Firebase, Google Maps API, and AI-powered features.

The app runs natively on both Android and Desktop, sharing business logic while delivering platform-specific experiences. Let's dive in!"

Aurora is built with Kotlin Multiplatform, meaning the business logic, data models, and database layer are shared across platforms. You're seeing the Android version today, but the same codebase powers Desktop and iOS versions.

**Tech Stack:**
- Kotlin 2.0 with Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0
- Firebase Authentication and Firestore
- Google Maps API for real routing
- Gemini AI API for intelligent assistance
- Real-time synchronization
- Offline-first architecture"

**[Screen: Back to README or app showcase]**

"Aurora demonstrates Kotlin Multiplatform's power through:

1. **Real-world complexity**: Not a demo - a fully functional app
2. **Advanced integrations**: Firebase, Google Maps, AI, real-time chat
3. **True multiplatform**: Android shown today, Desktop and iOS versions share the same codebase
4. **Production quality**: 25+ screens, comprehensive error handling, offline support
5. **Original work**: Built from scratch for this contest

Aurora is more than a navigation app - it's a complete transportation ecosystem promoting sustainable carpool solutions while showcasing what Kotlin Multiplatform can truly achieve.
